# Hi there 👋
## :sleeping: About me
I am studying at the **College of Communications No. 54** in the specialty "*Information Systems and Programming*". 

I got carried away with development at school, so after the 9th grade I made a conscious decision to start professional education in this field (contrary to the established traditions in society, I languish for two more years at school and go to university).
