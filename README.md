# Hi there 👋
## :sleeping: About me
I am studying at the College of Communications No. 54 in the specialty "Information Systems and Programming". 

I got carried away with development at school, so after the 9th grade I made a conscious decision to start professional education in this field (contrary to the established traditions in society, I languish for two more years at school and go to university).

## :tada: Hackathons 
- LETS HACK 2024 🥇
- Школа Будущего 2024 🥇 - not really a hackathon, but come on
- KS54HACK 🥇

## :computer: Work experience 
In addition to hackathons, our team is also involved in the development of an online learning product from our college. 

I am responsible for the backend (API) for mobile and web applications
