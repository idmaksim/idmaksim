## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am studying at the College of Communications No. 54 in the specialty "Information Systems and Programming". I got carried away with development at school, so after the 9th grade I made a conscious decision to start professional education in this field (contrary to the established traditions in society, I languish for two more years at school and go to university).

In college, I gathered a team of developers, with whom we regularly and very successfully participate in hackathons, including:
LETS HACK 2024, Ð¨ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð° Ð‘ÑƒÐ´ÑƒÑ‰ÐµÐ³Ð¾ 2024, KS54HACK (1st place), TULA HACK, IT PLEKHANOV CUP (participation).

In addition to hackathons, our team is also involved in the development of an online learning product from our college. I am responsible for the backend (API) for mobile and web applications (stack: Python/fastapi, PostgreSQL, sqlalchemy, docker).
